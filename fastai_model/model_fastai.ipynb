and beer i go to some hollow and sit at my still and if whiskey do n't kill me then i do n't know what will i go to some xxunk and drink with my friends where the women ca n't follow and see what i spend god bless them pretty women i wish they was mine their breath is as sweet the dew on the vine let me eat when i am hungry let me drink when i am dry a dollar when i am xxunk religion when i die

for me i always have xxunk her for doin what she did and gettin free oh , whatever makes her happy i wo n't stand in the way though the bitter taste still xxunk on from the night i tried to make her stay i see a lot of people as i make the xxunk and i hear her name here and there as i go from town to town and i 've never xxunk used to it i 've just learned to turn it off either i 'm too xxunk or else i 'm gettin soft sundown , yellow moon i xxunk the past i know every scene by heart they all went by so fast if she 's xxunk back this way i 'm not that hard to find tell her she can look me up if she 's got the time,xxbos it 's written on our palms , and it 's written on our hearts it 's written in our songs , and it 's written in the stars sometimes all we can do is stand up tall when they

livin there , i hear say for me that i 'm all right though things get kind of slow she might think that i 've forgotten her do n't tell her it is n't so we had a xxunk like lovers often will and to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill and though our xxunk it pierced me to the heart she still lives inside of me we 've never been apart if you get close to her kiss her once for me i always have xxunk her for doin what she did and gettin free oh , whatever makes her happy i wo n't stand in the way though the bitter taste still xxunk on from the night i tried to make her stay i see a lot of people as i make the xxunk and i hear her name here and there as i go from town to town and i 've never xxunk used to it i 've just learned to turn it off either i 'm too xxunk or else i 'm gettin soft sundown , yellow moon i xxunk the past i know every scene by heart they all went by so fast if she 's xxunk back this way i 'm not that hard to find tell her she can look me up if she 's got the time,xxbos it 's written on our palms , and it 's written on our hearts it 's written in our songs , and it 's written in the stars sometimes all we can do is stand up tall when they 're standing in line just to watch us fall whoa we ca n't forget , these are the days whoa , do n't be afraid we ca n't forget , these are the days well , we got each other , and that 's all we need from here on out it 's just you and me two xxunk hearts up against the world that do n't stand a chance against this boy and girl we xxunk 'em down , fought bigger xxunk and i know , babe , we 're gon na be alright well , it feels like we 're living from pay check to check and we wake up wondering what might happen next yeah , sometimes it feels like we wo n't make it through but the hard times pass like the good ones do baby , wrap your fingers and hold on tight i 'll be right here beside you tonight baby , climb up here watch the city glow let 's make a wish on the xxunk below we 're making moments that we wo n't forget and feeling ones that have n't happened yet whoa do n't be afraid we ca n't forget these are the days,xxbos i 'm sorry , mother i 'm sorry , i let you down well , these days i 'm fine no these days i tend to lie i 'll take the west train , just by the side of xxunk just by my left brain , just by the side of the tin man i 'm sorry , brother i 'm sorry , i let cha down well , these days you 're fine no these days you tend to lie you 'll take the west train , just by the side of xxunk just by your left brain , just by the side of the tin man your time will come if you wait for it , if you wait for it it 's hard , believe me i 've tried but i keep coming up short i 'm sorry , lover you 're sorry , i bring you down well , these days i try and these days i tend to lie kinda thought i was a mystery and then i thought i was n't meant to be you said yourself xxunk , xxunk you were all alone your time will come if you wait for it , if you wait for it it 's hard , believe me i 've tried your time will come if you wait for it , if you wait for it it 's hard , believe me i 've tried but the rain wo n't fall for the both of us the sun wo n't shine on the both of us believe me when i say , that i would n't have it any other way your time will come if you wait for it , if you wait for it it 's hard , believe me i 've tried but i wo n't wait much longer
